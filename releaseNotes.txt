Release Notes for lineageos_stats.php

************ Version 0.4 *****************
Release Date: 2025-11-14

Version 0.4 makes this script usable and maintainable in the long term. 
It now has all the functionality that I originally planned for the script.
Now that the build list and population of the countries can be updated,
the script should work in the future when I am no longer around to maintain
the script. 

Changes:
1. Moved the data in the $countriesData and $buildData arrays to the 
countriesList.txt and buildsList.txt files, so that the data is imported 
when the script starts. The benefit is that the data can be updated and 
stored, so it isn't necessary to check for new data every time the 
script is run. 

2. Added the --update-devices, --update-pop, and --find-builds options. 
This will reduce the number of downloads to run the script, but these 
options can be used when it is necessary.  

3. Added the "Unsupported" tally in the Statuses table to sum the number of 
installs for official builds that are for unsupported versions.

4. Added the alternative names to countries, so people can look up countries 
using the names of countries in their local languages. 

5. Added a ReleaseNotes.txt file to keep track of changes.

6. Added build info for all the unofficial builds that I can find with
Google searches. I also added links to many of the unofficial builds, so
people looking for the builds can find them. In many cases, I couldn't
find the ROMs, but I added the model info if I was able to find it.
