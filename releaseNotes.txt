Release Notes for lineageos_stats.php

************ Version 0.4 *****************
Release Date: 2025-11-14

Version 0.4 makes this script usable and maintainable in the long term. 
It now has all the functionality that I originally planned for the script.
Now that the build list and population of the countries can be updated,
the script should work in the future when I am no longer around to maintain
the script. 

Changes:
1. Moved the data in the $countriesData and $buildData arrays to the 
countriesList.txt and buildsList.txt files, so that the data is imported 
when the script starts. The benefit is that the data can be updated and 
stored, so it isn't necessary to check for new data every time the 
script is run. 

2. Added the --update-devices, --update-pop, and --find-builds options. 
This will reduce the number of downloads to run the script, but these 
options can be used when it is necessary.  

3. Added the "Unsupported" tally in the Statuses table to sum the number of 
installs for official builds that are for unsupported versions.

4. Added the alternative names to countries, so people can look up countries 
using the names of countries in their local languages. 

5. Added a ReleaseNotes.txt file to keep track of changes.

6. Added build info for all the unofficial builds that I can find with
Google searches. I also added links to many of the unofficial builds, so
people looking for the builds can find them. In many cases, I couldn't
find the ROMs, but I added the model info if I was able to find it. 


************ Version 0.5 *****************
Release Date: 2025-11-15

Fixed many things that I overlooked in the version 0.4 release.

Changes:
1. Renamed the -o/--official option to -S/--supported. Changed
Tally->addBuild() and Tally->finalize() calculate the unsupported 
installs for all statuses ('O', 'D' and 'U'). 

2. Renamed the -d/--update-devices option to -u/--update-builds.

3. Dealt with the discrepencies between build variants, by only using
the more common variant when updating the build information.

4. Rewrote the Help/README to reflect default behavior that doesn't 
download the countries pages and search for new builds by default.

5. Changed most of the options from $GLOBALS to defined constants.

6. Now the buildsList.txt file is rewritten if either --update-builds or 
--find-builds options were selected.
 
7. Changed Tally->addBuild() to only count installs as "official" if
they are in the list of officially supported versions for the build. 
This is the big change that made me decide to do a new release. 

8. Got rid of all the old code for -i/--only-installs option which is no
longer used.

9. Also filed a bug report (https://github.com/lineageos-infra/issues/issues/22)
so hopefully can fix the bad country codes in the future in the code
